// Mirrors WebCore basic_catalog/components/basic_components.test.ts
//
// WebCore's test iterates over every ComponentApi entry in BASIC_COMPONENTS
// (an array of Zod schema objects) and verifies that each component:
//   - exists in the official basic_catalog.json specification file,
//   - has matching property names,
//   - has matching required flags, and
//   - has matching description strings on every property.
// This is a Zod-schema-to-JSON-spec alignment test and has no direct Swift
// equivalent (Swift has no Zod schemas or runtime JSON Schema comparison).
//
// In Swift, BASIC_COMPONENT_NAMES is a plain Set<String>. The closest
// applicable test is to verify the set contains exactly the expected 18
// component names — preserving the core intent that all Basic Catalog
// components are registered.

    // Mirrors the name-presence check from WebCore's schema-alignment test:
    // "verifies all basic components exist in the catalog and their required
    //  properties and descriptions align"
    //
    // NOTE: Property-level and description-level checks from the WebCore test
    // are not applicable — they compare Zod schema metadata against a JSON spec
    // file, a mechanism that doesn't exist in Swift. Swift type correctness is
    // guaranteed at compile time by Codable.
